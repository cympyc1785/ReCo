## 📊 ReCo-Data Preparation

**ReCo-Data** is a large-scale, high-quality video editing dataset consisting of **500K+ instruction–video pairs**, covering four video editing tasks: **object addition (add)**, **object removal (remove)**, **object replacement (replace)**, and **video stylization (style)**.

<p align="center">
    <img src="assets/statistic.png" width="800"/>
<p>

### Downloading ReCo-Data

Please download each task of ReCo-Data into the `./ReCo-Data` directory by running:

```bash
bash ./tools/download_dataset.sh
````

Before downloading the full dataset, you may first browse the
**[visualization examples](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HiDream-ai/ReCo-Data/blob/main/examples.tar)**.

These examples are collected by **randomly sampling 50 instances from each task**
(add, remove, replace, and style), **without any manual curation or cherry-picking**,
and are intended to help users quickly inspect and assess the overall data quality.

Note: The examples are formatted for visualization convenience and do not strictly follow the dataset format.

### Directory Structure

After downloading, please ensure that the dataset follows the directory structure below:

<details open>
<summary>ReCo-Data directory structure</summary>

```text

├── add/
│   ├── add_data_configs.json

    └── tar_videos/
        ├── video1-a_Van_Gogh_style.mp4
        └── ...
```

</details>

### Testing and Visualization

After downloading the dataset, you can directly test and visualize samples from **any single task** using the following script
(taking the **replace** task as an example):

```bash
python scripts/reco_data_test_single.py \
  --json_path ./ReCo-Data/replace/replace_data_configs.json \
  --video_folder ./ReCo-Data \
  --debug
```

### Mixed Task Loading

You can also load a **mixed dataset** composed of the four tasks (**add**, **remove**, **replace**, and **style**) with arbitrary ratios by running:

```bash
python scripts/reco_data_test_mix_data.py \
  --json_folder ./ReCo-Data \
  --video_folder ./ReCo-Data \
  --debug
```

### Notes

* `src_videos/` contains the original source videos.
* `tar_videos/` contains the edited target videos corresponding to each instruction.
* `*_data_configs.json` stores the instruction–video mappings and metadata for each task.



## 📈 Evaluation

### VLLM-based Evaluation Benchmark
<details close>
<summary>ReCo-Bench details</summary>

Traditional video generation metrics often struggle to accurately assess the fidelity and quality of video editing results. Inspired by recent image editing evaluation protocols, we propose a **VLLM-based evaluation benchmark** to comprehensively and effectively evaluate video editing quality.


We collect **480 video–instruction pairs** as the evaluation set, evenly distributed across four tasks: **object addition**, **object removal**, **object replacement**, and **video stylization** (120 pairs per task). All source videos are collected from the **Pexels** video platform.


For local editing tasks (add, remove, and replace), we utilize **Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking** to automatically generate diverse editing instructions conditioned on video content. For video stylization, we randomly select **10 source videos** and apply **12 distinct styles** to each, resulting in **120 stylization evaluation pairs**.

### 1. Downloading ReCo-Bench
Please download **ReCo-Bench** into the `./ReCo-Bench` directory by running:
```bash
bash ./tools/download_ReCo-Bench.sh
````



---



### 2. Usage

After downloading the benchmark, you can directly start the evaluation using:
```bash
cd tools
bash run_eval_via_gemini.sh
```


<details close>
<summary>This script performs the evaluation in two stages:</summary>

#### Step 1: Per-dimension Evaluation with Gemini
In the first stage, **Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking** is used as a VLLM evaluator to score each edited video across multiple evaluation dimensions.

Key arguments used in this step include:
* `--edited_video_folder`: Path to the folder containing the edited (target) videos generated by the model.

* `--src_video_folder`: Path to the folder containing the original source videos.

* `--base_txt_folder`: Path to the folder containing task-specific instruction configuration files.

* `--task_name`: Name of the evaluation task, one of `{add, remove, replace, style}`.



This step outputs per-video, per-dimension evaluation results in JSON format.

#### Step 2: Final Score Aggregation

After all four tasks have been fully evaluated, the second stage aggregates the evaluation results and computes the final scores.
* `--json_folder`: Path to the JSON output folder generated in Step 1

  (default: `all_results/gemini_results`)

* `--base_txt_folder`: Path to the instruction configuration folder

This step produces the final benchmark scores for each task as well as the overall performance.

## 🏃 Inference

### 1. Environment Preparation

Create and activate the specialized Conda environment:

```bash
conda create -n reco python=3.11 -y
conda activate reco
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Model Weights Setup

You need to prepare both the base model and our specific checkpoints.

<!-- | Model | Source | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **VACE 1.3B** | [🤗 Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Wan-AI/Wan2.1-VACE-1.3B) | Base VACE weights (Place in `./Wan-AI`) |
| **ReCo** | [🤗 Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/HiDream-ai/ReCo) | Our ReCo checkpoint(Place in `all_ckpts/`). We will update better ckpts progressively afterward | -->

**Organize the files as follows:**
```text
.
├── Wan-AI/                      
├── all_ckpts/

├── assets/                      
└── scripts/
    └── inference_reco_single.py
```

### 3. Running Inference

We provide a bash script to automate the execution of different tasks (Replace, Remove, Style, Add and Propagation). Run the following command:

```bash
bash scripts/infer_server_single.sh
```

To run a specific task manually or customize the execution, use the python command directly:

```bash
python scripts/inference_reco_single.py \
    --task_name replace \
    --test_txt_file_name assets/replace_test.txt \
    --lora_ckpt ReCo_ori_rank128-2025_m12_version.ckpt
```

| Argument | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `test_txt_file_name` | `str` | `assets/...` | Path to the `.txt` file containing test prompts/configs. |
| `task_name` | `str` | `replace` | Task type: `remove`, `replace`, `add`, `style`. Use the `_wf` suffix (e.g., `remove_wf`) for **Propagation tasks** given the first frame. |
| `base_video_folder` | `str` | `assets/test_videos` | Directory containing the source videos. |
| `base_wan_folder` | `str` | `./Wan-AI` | Path to the pre-trained Wan-AI model weights. |
| `lora_ckpt` | `str` | `all_ckpts/...` | Path to the specific LoRA checkpoint file. |

### 4. Running Inference with IP condition

Run the IP-conditioned inference script:

```bash
bash scripts/infer_server_single_ref_rank256.sh
```

This script calls `scripts/inference_reco_single_ref.py` and demonstrates different modes: prompt-only, IP-image-only, first-frame-only, or using both IP image and first-frame conditioning together.


## 🚀 Training

### 1) Basic Training

Run:

```bash
bash scripts/train.sh
```

Before launching training:

* Update the **pretrained model weight paths** in your script to match local paths.
* In `scripts/train.py`, update dataset paths in `LightningModelForTrain.train_dataloader`:
  * **JSON annotation directory**
  * **Video data directory**

### 2) Multi-task Training with IP Reference Data

We additionally provide multi-task training code with IP-image references, which additionally supports:

* background replacement with a given reference image
* object replacement with a given reference image
* object addition with a given reference image

To start this training pipeline, follow two steps:

**Step 1. Prepare data configs and local paths**

1. Download task config/data package from  
   [kiwidata.zip](https://huggingface.co/HiDream-ai/ReCo/blob/main/kiwidata/kiwidata.zip),  
   then place/extract it under the current project.
2. Update related configs in:
   * `scripts/train_multitask_add_kiwi_ref_data.py` (around `196-210`)
   * `kiwidata/test_dataset_mixdata.py` (around `32-54`)

**Step 2. Launch training**

```bash
bash scripts/train_multitask_add_kiwi_ref_data.sh
```

This pipeline includes mixed data loading from **ReCo-Data**, **DiTTO**, and **OpenVE-3M**, and also integrates kiwi-edit paired IP-reference data. The `kiwidata` folder provides our filtered and organized config files that better match the original dataset formats. Feel free to use and adapt them.
